If your music player can export the current playing song to a text file with the format %artist% - %title%, you can use this tool to watch that text file for changes and automatically pull the best rated chords from ulitmate-guitar.com and show them in plain view without all the clutter around.

Currently the path to the text file is hardcoded as %user.home%/Documents/amip/foobar-playing.txt
